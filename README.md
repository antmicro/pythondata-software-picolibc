# pythondata-software-picolibc

picolibc source files packaged into a Python module so they can be used with Python libraries and tools.

This is useful for usage with tools like
[LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex.git).

The data files can be found under the Python module `pythondata_software_picolibc`. The
`pythondata_software_picolibc.data_location` value can be used to find the files on the file
system.

Yoinked from [pythondata-software-compiler_rt](https://github.com/litex-hub/pythondata-software-compiler_rt)
so some files are not even changed
